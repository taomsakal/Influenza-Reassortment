* Renamed self.iteration to self.model_step to avoid confusion. (I'm still not totally clear on the difference though.)
* Fixed data collection being off one timestep? 
* Made data also get collected at time zero. 

### Formatting Changes
* Cleaned up code formatting
* Removed redundant parentheses  
* Fixed inconsistency of random package being imported both under * and the name "rand". Now it is all under "random".
